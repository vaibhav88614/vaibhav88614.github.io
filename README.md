## üìÅ Project Structure (Updated)

```
src/
	assets/             # Source images (originals)
	styles/             # Centralized style layers
		base.css          # Tailwind layers + global base
		design-tokens.css # CSS custom properties / theme tokens
		animations.css    # Animation utilities & keyframes
	components/         # Reusable UI components
		ui/               # UI primitives (accordion, button, etc.)
	hooks/              # Custom React hooks
	lib/                # Utility functions
	pages/              # Main pages (Index, NotFound)
	main.tsx            # App entry (imports consolidated styles)
public/
	images/             # Deployed static images (copied via organize-assets.ps1)
docs/                 # Vite build output (served by GitHub Pages)
```

### Asset Workflow
- Keep canonical images in `src/assets/`.
- Run `./organize-assets.ps1` to copy them into `public/images/` for stable public paths `/images/...`.
- Build places processed/hased files inside `docs/` automatically.

### Style Workflow
- Do not add Tailwind directives in scattered files‚Äîkeep them in `styles/base.css`.
- Add/modify design tokens in `styles/design-tokens.css`.
- Add new animations to `styles/animations.css`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Development

1. **Clone the repo**
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/vaibhav88614/vaibhav88614.github.io.git
	cd vaibhav88614.github.io
	```
2. **Install dependencies**
	```sh
	npm install
	```
3. **Start development server**
	```sh
	npm run dev
	```
4. **Build for production**
	```sh
	npm run build
	```

---

## ÔøΩ Deployment (GitHub Pages via docs/)

This repository is configured so Vite outputs directly into the `docs/` folder (see `vite.config.ts`). GitHub Pages should be set to:

Branch: `main`  |  Folder: `/docs`

### Deploy steps

```sh
# Build & deploy
npm run build
./deploy.ps1
```

The script will:
- Ensure the working tree is clean (unless you pass `-Force`)
- Confirm `docs/` exists and add `.nojekyll`
- Commit only if build output changed

### One-liner (force deploy)
```powershell
./deploy.ps1 -Force
```

### Custom domain (optional)
Add a `CNAME` file inside `docs/` containing your domain name.

---

## üßπ Cleaning Legacy Build Artifacts

If you previously copied hashed build files (e.g. `index-XYZ.js`) into the repo root, you can move them out non-destructively:

```powershell
./cleanup-build-artifacts.ps1
```

Moved files live in `_old-root-build/`. Inspect and delete when you're satisfied.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Organizing Assets

To copy all current raw images into `public/images/` (non-destructive):

```powershell
./organize-assets.ps1
```

Add `-Force` to overwrite duplicates if filenames collide:

```powershell
./organize-assets.ps1 -Force
```

Then reference them in code or meta tags as `/images/<name>`.
